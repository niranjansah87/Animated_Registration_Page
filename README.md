Animated Sign-Up Page with Password Validation and Reveal Feature

This repository contains a modern and visually appealing sign-up page with animated elements built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The sign-up form includes comprehensive password validation features to ensure strong and secure passwords are created by users. The validation checks include length validation, uppercase letter requirement, number requirement, and special character requirement.

In addition to password validation, the sign-up form also includes a password reveal feature, allowing users to toggle between hiding and revealing their password while typing. This feature enhances user experience by providing flexibility and convenience without compromising security.

The animated elements of the sign-up page are implemented using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), adding smooth transitions and dynamic visual effects to create an engaging user interface.
