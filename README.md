The sign-up form includes comprehensive password validation features to ensure strong and secure passwords are created by users. The validation checks include length validation, uppercase letter requirement, number requirement, and special character requirement.</p> <p>In addition to password validation, the sign-up form also includes a password reveal feature, allowing users to toggle between hiding and revealing their password while typing. This feature enhances user experience by providing flexibility and convenience without compromising security.</p> <p>The animated elements of the sign-up page are implemented using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), adding smooth transitions and dynamic visual effects to create an engaging user interface.</p> <h2>Key Features</h2> <ul> <li>Modern and visually appealing sign-up page design.</li> <li>Comprehensive password validation (length, uppercase letter, number, special character).</li> <li>Password reveal feature for enhanced user experience.</li> <li>Smooth animations and transitions using GSAP.</li> </ul> <h2>Technologies Used</h2> <ul> <li>HTML5</li> <li>CSS3</li> <li>JavaScript</li> <li>GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)</li> </ul> <h2>Usage</h2> <ol> <li>Clone the repository to your local machine.</li> <li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in your web browser to view the animated sign-up page.</li> <li>Use the sign-up form to create a new account, and experience the password validation and reveal features.</li> </ol> <h2>Contributing</h2> <p>Contributions are welcome!
